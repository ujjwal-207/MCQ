# 📚 MCQ Generator

A streamlined application that automatically generates Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from uploaded PDF or text documents using LangChain and LLM technology.

## ✨ Features

- **📄 Document Processing**: Upload and process PDF or text files
- **❓ Custom MCQ Generation**: Create questions based on specific topics from the uploaded content
- **🔢 Difficulty Selection**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels
- **🖥️ User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive Streamlit-based UI

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application uses a pipeline approach to generate high-quality MCQs:

1. **📥 Document Loading**: The system accepts PDF or text files as input
2. **🔍 Text Processing**: Content is extracted and processed for knowledge extraction
3. **🧠 LLM Integration**: Utilizes LangChain framework to connect with Large Language Models
4. **✏️ Question Generation**: Creates contextually relevant MCQs based on user-specified parameters
5. **📊 Result Display**: Presents formatted questions with multiple choice options
